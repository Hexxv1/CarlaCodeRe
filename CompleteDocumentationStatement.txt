Fine-tuned collision detection with the road boundary to provide feedback to the user via a hit counter.
Performance Optimization:
Ensured rain and snow effects did not degrade performance by recycling off-screen elements.
Summary of Key Learning Points
Prioritizing Simplicity:
You learned that custom lightweight solutions (like Pygame) can achieve your goals more efficiently when high-performance tools (like CARLA) are too resource-intensive.
Iterative Development:
You adopted a step-by-step approach, starting with basic movement, adding features incrementally (like weather effects), and refining the visuals and logic.
Interactive Design:
Providing user control (like selecting weather conditions) made the simulation more engaging and user-friendly.
Problem-Solving and Adaptability:
You demonstrated resilience in tackling installation issues, transitioning to alternatives, and refining the project to meet your requirements.
Current State
The project has a functional top-down vehicle simulation with:
Realistic controls and physics (acceleration, turning, and friction).
Dynamic weather effects (rain, snow, tornado).
Interactive menu for choosing weather conditions.
Boundary tracking to monitor collisions.
Future Ideas
Scoring Mechanism:
Add a scoring system to reward players for avoiding boundary collisions.
Dynamic Obstacles:
Introduce moving obstacles or traffic to make the simulation more challenging.
Multiple Vehicles:
Allow multiple cars to be controlled or appear as AI-controlled traffic.
Expand the Road System:
Add intersections, curved roads, or a procedurally generated map.
By iterating on this project, you can achieve a fun, lightweight, and feature-rich vehicle simulation tailored to your needs!
